Create an Image Classifier

This is an image classifier created in Python. It takes an image from the webcam, or uploaded by the user, and returns the category it belongs to.

Getting Started

Required Packages and Libraries:

- Python 2.7
- Scikit-learn
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV*

* This project uses the xfeatures2d module not included in the standard version of OpenCV. The extra modules can be found at https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib

To run the program:
- Open terminal
- Navigate to the directory:

cd ~/directorywithfiles

- Run the script:

python SocialApp.py

- Use the Take Picture button to capture an image with the webcam. This image will be saved automatically in the same directory. As of this time, it will not show a preview of the image.
- Use the Show Keypoints button to superimpose keypoints on an uploaded image.
- Use the Predict button to run the classifier on a chosen image. This will take a moment.
